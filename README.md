# SocialSphere
This project is a robust SocialSphere developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It empowers users to perform various social media actions such as posting, commenting, liking, sending friend requests, and resetting passwords using OTP for enhanced security.

## Features
RESTful Architecture: Utilizes Express.js for efficient routing control and handling HTTP requests.
User Authentication: Implements signup, login, logout, and logout from all devices functionalities. Provides extra security by storing login tokens and supports advanced features like updating user profiles.
Post Management: Supports CRUD operations for posts with fields like caption and image URL. Ensures each post references the user who created it.
Comment System: Allows users to add, update, and delete comments on posts. Comments can be managed by the post owner or the commenter.
Like Functionality: Provides like system for posts with logic implemented using MongoDB. Displays counts of likes and comments on posts.
Friendship Features: Implements friendship system with features like getting user friends, managing pending friend requests, and accepting/rejecting friend requests.
OTP-Based Password Reset: Includes OTP-based password reset feature for enhanced security.
Error Handling and Logging: Implements error handling middleware and request logging for improved debugging and monitoring.
